      <description>The obstacle_detector package provides utilities to detect and track obstacles from data provided by 2D laser scanners. Detected obstacles come in a form of line segments or circles. The package was designed for a robot equipped with two laser scanners therefore it contains several additional utilities. The working principles of the method are described in an article provided in the resources folder.
The package requires Armadillo C++library for compilation and runtime.</description>
